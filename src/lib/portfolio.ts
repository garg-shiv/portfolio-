We compiled a labeled dataset of monkeypox and non-monkeypox skin images. An advanced CNN was trained to extract texture, shape, and lesion features. A Vision Transformer was integrated to capture global context and long-range dependencies. This hybrid model achieves high accuracy and robustness, offering a rapid diagnostic aid for clinicians",
